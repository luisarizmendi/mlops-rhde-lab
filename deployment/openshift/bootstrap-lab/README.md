# OpenShift Edge Computing Demos

Welcome to the OpenShift Edge Computing Demos repository! This collection features use case demonstrations leveraging Red Hat OpenShift (OCP) and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) to showcase edge computing capabilities.

## Available Demos

Explore the following demos to see OpenShift in action:

* **[Workload Placement](demos/placement/README.md)**: Learn how ACM assists in determining the optimal OCP cluster for deploying your edge application based on the dynamic conditions of your environment.

* **[OpenShift Zero Touch Provisioning](demos/ztp/README.md)**: Discover how to deploy OpenShift clusters at edge locations with minimal manual intervention. This demo presents three automated deployment approaches, simplifying edge site operations.
