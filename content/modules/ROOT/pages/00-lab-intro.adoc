Some of this information is pre-configured as global variables in the xref:https://github.com/luisarizmendi/workshop-object-detection-rhde/blob/main/content/antora.yml[antora.yml] file. These variables will automatically populate in the workshop guide.

However, there is user-specific information that must be entered manually. Your instructor will provide these values. Use the input boxes in the guideâ€™s header to fill them in. If not entered, placeholders (e.g., USER_NAME) will appear in the guide.
