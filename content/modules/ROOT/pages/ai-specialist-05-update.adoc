9. Prometheus and Grafana

Overview

Prometheus and Grafana are integral to OpenShift AI’s monitoring stack, providing metrics collection, visualization, and alerting.

Usage with RHEL Inference

Configure Prometheus on RHEL to expose metrics (e.g., inference latency, resource usage).

Forward these metrics to OpenShift AI’s monitoring stack for centralized visualization and analysis in Grafana.

10. Trust Management

Overview

OpenShift AI ensures secure deployment and serving of models with trust management capabilities, including custom certificates and token-based authentication.

Usage with RHEL Inference

Secure inference endpoints on RHEL using certificates and authentication tokens generated in OpenShift AI.

Integrate secure communication channels between RHEL inference servers and OpenShift AI monitoring systems.
