= Model Building

The process of AI model building is a multistep journey that transforms raw data into a functional model. It encompasses several key stages, each playing a crucial role in ensuring the model can learn, generalize, and ultimately perform as required. This section will guide you through the essential steps of engineering, training, and evaluation.

While these three stages (Engineering, Training, and Evaluation) are commonly used to describe the model-building process, it's important to note that there are other ways to segment the workflow. For example, some frameworks emphasize Feature Engineering as distinct stages, while others may break down Model Selection or Hyperparameter Optimization as separate steps. Each approach can vary depending on the complexity of the project and the specific needs of the model being developed.

== Engineering


Engineering is the foundation of the model building process, where data and features are prepared and transformed into a form that can be consumed by the model. This stage involves selecting appropriate algorithms, designing architectures, and preparing the training scripts.

== Training

Training is the next phase, where the prepared data is fed into the model, and the model's parameters are iteratively adjusted to minimize errors and improve performance. This step requires careful attention to hyperparameter tuning, managing computational resources, and monitoring the training process to avoid issues like overfitting or underfitting.

== Evaluation

Evaluation is crucial in determining how well the model has learned from the training data and how effectively it can generalize to unseen data. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to assess the model's performance. Rigorous evaluation helps identify potential areas for improvement and ensures that the model meets the desired standards before deployment.
