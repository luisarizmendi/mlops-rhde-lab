= Application Developer

== Background

es through CI/CD pipelines, ensuring the resilience of applications, and adhering to strict security protocols. Applications must be scalable, modular, and designed for longevity, reflecting the strategic goals of ACME Co.’s software development group.

As you begin this journey, your work will not only shape the future of ACME Co.’s safety measures but also redefine how modern applications can drive transformative change in industrial environments.

== Toolset

To ensure seamless development, you'll need collaboration tools, complemented by a CI/CD pipeline for efficient version release management.

[NOTE]

You will find later that each section of this workshop outlines details about our tool selection rationale and explores alternative options you may consider.

* *OpenShift Developer Hub*: This internal developer portal centralizes access to resources, templates, and documentation, accelerating the onboarding process and standardizing application development across teams. It ensures consistency and visibility into microservices and APIs.

* *OpenShift Dev Spaces*: OpenShift Dev Spaces provides cloud-based development environments accessible directly from the browser. It offers pre-configured, containerized workspaces that mirror production, ensuring developers can write, test, and debug code in an environment that reflects the final deployment conditions.

* *OpenShift Pipelines*: Built on Tekton, OpenShift Pipelines automates CI/CD workflows, enabling fast, consistent builds, tests, and deployments of containerized applications. This tool ensures rapid iteration and integration, reducing downtime and accelerating feature delivery.

* *GitHub Source Code Repository*: GitHub serves as the version control system, providing a collaborative space for developers to track code changes, manage branches, and facilitate peer reviews. This fosters teamwork and ensures the codebase evolves securely and efficiently.

* *Container Image Registry*: A secure container image registry stores and manages application images, ensuring that developers can reliably push, pull, and deploy containers to different environments. It supports versioning and helps enforce security and compliance policies.
