= Day 2 Operations

As a Platform Specialist you now have under control the Edge Devices installed across the Edge perimeter and you are able to deploy new version of the Device or add Applications in a massive and declarative way thanks to Flight Control.

== OS Configuration

In the case of Image Base OS, it is usually best practice to include OS-level configuration into the OS image for maximum consistency and repeatability. To update configuration, a new OS image should be created and devices updated to the new image.

However, there are scenarios where this is impractical, for example, when configuration is missing in the image, needs to be specific to a device (with its dynamically generate uuid), needs to be update-able at runtime without updating the OS image and rebooting or if it contains secrets or keys that you might not want to publish with the Image. For these cases, Flight Control allows users to declare a set of configuration files that shall be present on the device's file system.

Conceptually, this set of configuration files can be thought of as an additional, dynamic layer on top of the OS image's layers. The Flight Control Agent applies updates to this layer transactionally, ensuring that either all files have been successfully updated in the file system or have been returned to their pre-update state. Further, if the user updates both a devices OS and configuration set at the same time, the Flight Control Agent will first update the OS, then apply the specified configuration set on top.

After the Flight Control Agent has updated the configuration on disk, this configuration still needs to be activated. That means, running services need to reload the new configuration into memory for it to become effective. If the update involves a reboot, services will be restarted by systemd in the right order with the new configuration automatically. If the update does not involve a reboot, many services can detect changes to their configuration files and automatically reload them. When a service does not support this, you use Device Lifecycle Hooks to specify rules like "if configuration file X has changed, run command Y".

Users can specify a list of configurations sets, in which case the Flight Control Agent applies the sets in sequence and on top of each other, such that in case of conflict the "last one wins".

Configuration can come from multiple sources, called "configuration providers" in Flight Control. Flight Control currently supports the following configuration providers:

* Git Config Provider: Fetches device configuration files from a Git repository.
* Kubernetes Secret Provider: Fetches a Secret from a Kubernetes cluster and writes its content to the device's file system.
* HTTP Config Provider: Fetches device configuration files from an HTTP(S) endpoint.
* Inline Config Provider: Allows specifying device configuration files inline in the device manifest without querying external systems.

What we would need to add in this case in terms of configuration, is the pull-secret for Microshift that will be placed under `/etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret`

Since the Device is managed under a Fleet, we would need to update the Fleet template to include this configuration file (you might also want to add more labels to select for example only the Devices that include Microshift for this specific case).

We can decide to process through the CLI or GUI

[source,bash]
----
$ flightctl get fleet/my-fleet -o yaml > fleet.yaml

apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: Fleet
metadata:
  labels:
    env: test

          path: /etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret
        name: pull-secret

----

image::platform-flight-control-configuration-file.png[]

We can now proceed and start Microshift again with more success after checking that the Nvidia Device has received the new pull-secret.

[source,bash]
----
$ cat /etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret
...
$ sudo systemctl enable microshift --now
----

After 5 to 10 minutes (downloading the container images) you should be able to see the pods running on the Nvidia Device

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo oc --kubeconfig /var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/kubeconfig get pods -A

Now that Microshift is up and running you might want to also monitor the status of this specific service across your Fleet.

We are now ready to deploy the Applications!

== Application deployment

You can deploy, update, or undeploy applications on a device by updating the list of applications in the device's specification. The next time the agent checks in, it learns of the change in the specification, downloads any new or updated application packages and images from an OCI-compatible registry, and deploys them to the appropriate application runtime or removes them from that runtime.

At the moment the following runtimes and formats are supported: 

* Podman:	podman-compose
* Podman: Quadlet
* MicroShift: Kubernetes manifests

Let's recap for a minute, before deploying anything, what we would like the final application workflow to be.

image::ai-deploy-object-detection-webcam.png[]

On the local *Nvidia Edge Device* we should be running:

* Inference Server app
* Camera Stream Manager app
* Actuator app

In the Cloud, on *OpenShift Cluster*:

* Dashboard Backend app
* Dashboard Frontend app

We are now going to deploy the local apps on the Edge Device and then we will proceed with the cloud deployment (assuming you haven't deployed that in the xref:ai-specialist-04-deploy.adoc[AI Specialist App Deployment]). 

=== Edge Applications

To add a new application to a device, we will be modifying the Fleet Device Spec template, specifying the following parameters:

* Name: a user-defined name for the application
* Image: a reference to an application package in an OCI registry
* EnvVars (optional) a list of key/value-pairs that will be passed to the deployment tool as environment variables or command line flags.

[source,bash]
----
$ flightctl get fleet/my-fleet -o yaml > fleet.yaml
...
   spec:
      updatePolicy:
        downloadSchedule:
          at: "* 9-16 * * *"
        updateSchedule:
          at: "0 9 * * 5"
      applications: []
...
----

=== Cloud Applications

You can follow these steps:

. Create a new OpenShift Project (`userpass:[<span id="gnumberVal"></span>]-ai-test`)

. Deploy the backend using the following manifests (you can use the `+` icon on the top right corner of the OpenShift Console to paste them)
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="attributes"]

----

. Create the frontend application. This time you cannot just copy-paste the manifests below since you will need to include in the Deployment manifest a value for the `BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` environment variable. You can get the Backend URL if you check it in the `Networking > Routes` menu in the OpenShift Console (it will something like `http://object-detection-dashboard-backend-user99-test.apps.cluster-hkr2j.hkr2j.sandbox1307.opentlc.com`)

----

. Go to Routes in the OpenShift Console and take note of the Backend and Frontend URLs

You can now test the access to the dashboard navigating to the Dashboard Frontend URL.

CAUTION: The Dashboard application does not use TLS, so the URL must start `http://` and `https://` otherwhile you will get a message "Application is not available" even when then POD is already running. 

=== Integrated Applications Test


== OS Update

You can update a device's OS by updating the target OS image name or version in the device's specification. The next time the agent checks in, it learns of the requested update and automatically starts downloading and verifying the new OS version in the background. It then schedules the actual system update to be performed according to the update policy. When the time has come to update, it installs the new version in parallel and performs a reboot into the new version.

In this case we are going to generate a new image that includes `cockpit-ostree` package, which will allow us to visualize graphically on the cockpit the update tree for the target system.

[source,bash]
----
$ flightctl get fleet/my-fleet -o yaml > fleet.yaml
...
   spec:
      updatePolicy:
        downloadSchedule:
          at: "* 9-16 * * *"
        updateSchedule:
          at: "0 9 * * 5"
      applications: []
...
----

In this case we have decided to download updates everyday, during working hours and we are going to reboot into updated version only on Saturdays, because we know this shift is going to be covered by Ops team.

Let's now add the required package

[source,docker]
----
FROM {container-registry-gitea}/group-name-change-me/nvidia:0.0.2

RUN dnf -y install cockpit-ostree; \
    dnf -y clean all
----

and build and push the new image to the local registry.

We can now change the Fleet definition and point to the reference OS Image URL.

[source,bash]
----
$ flightctl get fleet/my-fleet -o yaml > fleet.yaml
...
    spec:
      applications: []
      os:
        image: {container-registry-gitea}/group-name-change-me/nvidia:0.0.2
      config:
----

and wait for the agent to take care of downloading the new image.

You should also be able to see that happening in the Dashboard.

image::platform-flight-control-os-update1.png[]

image::platform-flight-control-os-update2.png[]

Mind you, it might take a while for the agent to download the image (should the agent timeout, you can restart the service easily with `systemctl restart flightctl-agent.service`), but you should now see the Device is ready for reboot.

image::platform-flight-control-os-update3.png[]

which we will trigger manually. After that you should be able to see a new section inside cockpit.

WARNING: SELINUX might be blocking your cockpit interface, you can temporarily disable it with `setenforce 0`

image::platform-flight-control-os-update4.png[]


== Device Monitoring

One important element of Edge Device is preventive monitoring and maintenance, since most of them are really remote and losing one of them without previous notice might imply losing visibility on a whole remote site.

You can set up monitors for device resources and define alerts when the utilization of these resources crosses a defined threshold in Flight Control. When the agent alerts the Flight Control service, the service sets the device status to "degraded" or "error" (depending on the severity level) and may suspend the rollout of updates and alert the user as a result.

Note this is not meant to replace an observability solution. 

Resource monitors take the following parameters:

* MonitorType: the resource to monitor. Currently supported resources are "CPU", "Memory", and "Disk".
* SamplingInterval 	the interval in which the monitor samples utilization, specified as positive integer followed by a time unit ('s' for seconds, 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours).
* AlertRules: a list of alert rules.
* Path: (Disk monitor only) the absolute path to the directory to monitor. Utilization reflects the filesystem containing the path, similar to df, even if it’s not a mount point.

Alert rules take the following parameters:

* Severity: the alert rule's severity level out of "Info", "Warning", or "Critical". Only one alert rule is allowed per severity level and monitor.
* Duration: the duration that resource utilization is measured and averaged over when sampling, specified as positive integer followed by a time unit ('s' for seconds, 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours). Must be smaller than the sampling interval.
* Percentage: the utilization threshold that triggers the alert, as percentage value (range 0 to 100 without the "%" sign).
* Description: a human-readable description of the alert. This is useful for adding details about the alert that might help with debugging

We are going to add a simple CPU monitor to the local Nvidia Device and make sure that threshold is so low that it triggers alerts.
But first let's examine the Device definition inside Flight Control.

[source,bash]
