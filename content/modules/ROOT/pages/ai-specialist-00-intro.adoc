As the AI specialist at ACME Co., you've been tasked with solving a critical safety issue that has plagued the plantâ€”workers neglecting to wear hardhats. Hardhats are the frontline defense against head injuries, yet too often, employees bypass this essential safety measure. The stakes are high, and the company is counting on your expertise to prevent the next accident.

Your mission is clear: develop an AI-driven solution to ensure every worker approaching machinery is wearing a hardhat. The plan? Leverage existing USB webcams and create an object detection model capable of identifying hardhats in real time. This will form a digital safety net, alerting supervisors the moment a worker steps into a hazardous area without proper protection.

As you dive into this project, your responsibilities will span the entire AI pipeline. You'll collect and label video footage, train a robust object detection model, and fine-tune its accuracy for real-world deployment. Working closely with the DevOps team, you'll integrate the model into the existing infrastructure, ensuring smooth deployment on the plant's industrial PCs (IPCs) equipped with NVIDIA GPUs.

Your tasks will include:

* Gathering and preparing datasets using video feeds from the plant floor.

* Building and training the object detection model focused on hardhat identification.

* Testing the model to refine accuracy and reduce false positives.
