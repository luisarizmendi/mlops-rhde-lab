== Use case summary
You are the recently appointed plant manager at ACME co. +
The company, which produces plastic bottles, just after hiring you, received some news coverage (and not for any good reason). +
During the last 3 months 3 major accidents happened, which resulted in serious injuries to machinery operators (and 2 of those happened in the plant you are now managing). +


Of course your task, beside as always improving efficiency and reducing cost of production, is preventing this from ever happening again.  +
Identifying manufacturing hazards is critical as: +

* Improves Workplace Safety: By accurately identifying hazards, employers can implement appropriate preventive measures to reduce the risk of accidents or injuries in the workplace. +
* Reduces Costs: Workplace accidents can result in costly medical expenses, compensation claims, and decreased productivity. Identifying hazards early on can prevent such incidents, saving companies time and money. +
* Ensures Compliance With Regulations: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has strict guidelines and regulations for workplace safety. Properly identifying hazards helps companies comply with these regulations and avoid penalties. +
* Enhances Productivity: Companies can maintain productivity by minimizing workplace accidents and injuries. A safe working environment also promotes employee morale, increasing efficiency and motivation. +
* Protects Workers’ Health: Manufacturing hazards pose physical risks and impact employees’ long-term health. Proper identification allows for implementing measures to protect workers from exposure to harmful substances or environments. +
* Builds a Positive Company Image: Employers who prioritize workplace safety by identifying and managing hazards demonstrate their commitment to their employees’ well-being. This helps attract top talent and improves the company’s overall reputation. +

You decide to propose a new initiative focused on reducing and preventing accident in the factory by leveraging Machine Learning and to test it in the plant before submitting the Business Case to HQ. +
You are going to build a ML model to detect PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) and alert worker not wearing equipment in real time. +
Luckily most of the hardware needed for this project is already available onsite: +

* some spare usb cameras to analyze video feed of workers getting closer to the machineries +
* some spare IPC (Industrial PC) equipped with Nvidia GPUs to perform inferencing on the images +

You now just need to hire your team! +

* borrowing some time from the local *Data Scientist / ML Engineer* to build and fine tune the model
* asking the remote *DevOps* team to help you build the Application and a way to deploy and update it easily
* asking the local *IT Platform Specialist* to help you monitor and automate this new Application
* you will also take part in it as *OT Specialist* and will configure the available Alerm Management System
